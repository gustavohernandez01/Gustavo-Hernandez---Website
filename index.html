        <div class="subheading mb-5">Writing BusinessðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name's Gustavo, and I have been practicing how to write stories ever since I was in elementary school! Iâ€™ve managed to develop a variety of my very own stories within the duration of my limited leisure time; however, I always wondered how I could improve significantly on the messages I try to convey throughout my storytelling. Consequently, I would often turn to others in order to receive any kind of feedback and criticism. At first, it was a bit difficult to adjust to receiving such feedback especially when they were very, very critical! However, I came to the understanding that perhaps their critique they provided to me and the stories Iâ€™ve developed were solely intended to improve the quality of the story. Because of this, I have decided to develop this website for any individual who seeks to become a better storyteller as well as those who are beginning their journey in terms of developing their own sorts of stories and literature. 
 <br><br>

        Criticism is a delightful attribute that derives from the writing world. Criticism not only helps with creating more stories, but it also helps with paving the way for better stories to make their way in making their debut. In fact, criticism has helped me debut this particular website for writers and critics alike! Criticism is not intended to hurt writers and their confidence within their literature, but rather it is meant for aiding said writers in adding more quality to their current skill set. If criticism does hurt an individual, then either the writer must learn to receive constructive criticism, OR the feedback in general was extremely harsh and therefore not contributive to any form of improvement whatsoever. Luckily for any individual willing to indulge themselves into the content of this platform, this website also helps with ensuring that oneâ€™s criticism is beneficial to oneâ€™s writing goals instead of serving as a harmful obstacle instead.<br><br>

       As a writer, my journey to getting this far was definitely far from easy. Back during my elementary school years, my writing sounded way too similar to existing stories, and every time my writing attempted to accomplish a goal, or to convey something relevant to the ongoing plot line, it always failed to do so. Considering the fact that I was just a kid, I never really noticed how awful my writing truly was at the time being. Therefore, I created a resolution to signify that I would in fact improve how I wrote my stories. Although I could clearly tell that my story writing had improved over the years by a major landslide, there was still plenty of work to be done to execute as much effort as possible. This is why I ended up asking for criticism from peers and friends, which I overall do not regret to this day even in the slightest. The writing I had just executed with the help of others was polished to a satisfying degree, and I wanted others to experience this feeling of euphoria that I had managed to encounter as I realized I was genuinely improving where I was most flawed within.
